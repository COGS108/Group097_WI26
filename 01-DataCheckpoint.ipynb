    "What is the relationship between screen time before bed, physical activity levels, sleep quality, and academic performance among college students? Specifically, we want to examine whether frequent electronic device use close to bedtime is associated with poorer self-reported sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and more difficulty falling asleep, and whether those sleep outcomes are in turn related to worse academic performance including lower self-reported grades, more missed classes, and difficulty completing assignments. Beyond that, we want to explore whether physical activity acts as a moderating variable in this relationship, meaning does regular exercise reduce or buffer the negative effects that screen time before bed has on sleep and academics? We will control for demographic factors like gender and year in school to make sure any relationships we find aren't being driven by those differences. The goal is to figure out not just whether screen time before bed hurts sleep and grades, but whether college students who are more physically active are less affected by it compared to students who aren't.\n"

    "Living in an era where technology is constantly evolving, it has impacted our lives immensely. Students today use smartphones and screens for almost every aspect of their lives, from attending virtual lectures to unwinding with social media after a long day of classes. Research has shown that this constant connectivity is fundamentally shifting sleep patterns among students and, as a result, their ability to perform academically [1, 2]. Because technology is so integrated into this generation's lifestyle, many students don't realize how much late-night scrolling might be affecting their next-day focus and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have found that excessive screen exposure disrupts the delicate balance required for restorative rest and cognitive functioning [1, 2]. The reason this happens is because screens emit blue light which suppresses melatonin production, the hormone responsible for signaling to your body that it's time to sleep [7, 8]. On top of that, social media use triggers cognitive arousal, where the brain is constantly processing new content, reacting to posts, and receiving small dopamine hits from notifications, making it much harder to wind down before bed [2, 8]. A systematic review of blue light research in young adults confirmed that evening blue light exposure delays circadian phase and increases sleep onset latency, leading to later bedtimes and shorter sleep duration [7]. Research has also found a direct link between these digital habits and lower academic outcomes, with students who have higher screen time consistently performing worse on exams and attending fewer classes [3, 6]. This topic is personally relevant to our team as well since we've noticed similar patterns in our own habits as college students, which is what motivated us to dig deeper into the existing research.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the work done previously by other researchers, we found that high screen time is consistently correlated with delayed sleep onset and reduced total sleep duration [1]. Previous cross-sectional analyses have shown that for young adults and children, excessive screen use is a primary predictor of poor sleep quality, often due to the blue light exposure and cognitive arousal mechanisms described above [2, 7]. We find it particularly interesting that sleep appears to act as a \"mediator.\" This means that while screen use impacts grades, it might be doing so because it ruins sleep first [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that when screen time is limited, there are measurable improvements in sleep duration and school grades [4]. Other predictive modeling has shown that as screen time increases, the probability of achieving high academic marks decreases [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side of things, physical activity has been consistently shown to improve sleep quality across various populations. A systematic review found that regular exercise reduces sleep onset latency, increases total sleep duration, and improves overall sleep quality [10]. A study of US adolescents aged 16 to 19 found that physical activity, screen time, and sleep are all closely related, with higher physical activity levels associated with better sleep outcomes even among students with high screen time [9]. What really caught our attention is a study on college-aged adults that found physical activity and sleep actually moderate the relationship between stress and screen time, where in highly active individuals screen time was essentially unrelated to stress levels [11]. This suggests that exercise might serve as a protective factor that buffers the negative effects of screen time on sleep and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most existing research looks at screen time, sleep, and physical activity as separate pieces rather than examining how they interact with each other. It's also worth noting that factors like gender and year in school could influence screen time habits, physical activity levels, and academic performance differently, so we plan to control for these demographic variables in our analysis. We want to bring all of these pieces together and see whether physical activity can actually reduce the damage that screen time before bed does to sleep quality and academic performance among college students.\n",

    "We hypothesize that students who use electronic devices more frequently before bed will have worse sleep quality, get less sleep overall, and have a harder time falling asleep. We think that these sleep problems will then carry over into their academics, leading to lower grades, more missed classes, and a harder time keeping up with assignments. Basically we don't think screen time before bed directly tanks your grades, but rather it messes up your sleep first and that's what actually hurts your performance. This idea of sleep acting as a mediator is backed up by the research we discussed in our background section, where blue light and cognitive arousal from screens are the main reasons sleep gets disrupted in the first place. The part we're most interested in though is whether physical activity changes this relationship. We predict that students who exercise regularly (like 3 or more times a week) won't be as affected by screen time before bed compared to students who barely exercise or don't exercise at all. So even if two students are both scrolling on their phones before sleeping, the one who works out regularly might still sleep fine while the other one doesn't. We're basing this on research discussed in our background showing that exercise on its own improves how fast you fall asleep and how long you stay asleep, and that in highly active college students screen time basically had no relationship with their stress levels. On top of that, we think that sleep quality is going to matter more for academic performance than just the number of hours someone sleeps. You can get 8 hours of sleep but if you were tossing and turning all night or kept waking up, that's not the same as 8 hours of solid rest. Both of our datasets let us look at this since the insomnia survey has sleep quality ratings and sleep hours as separate variables, and the CMU data has total sleep time alongside GPA. We expect these patterns to show up even when we account for things like gender and year in school since those could affect screen time habits and grades on their own."

    "### Dataset #2: CMU Sleep and GPA (Carnegie Mellon)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has objective sleep data from 634 first-year college students at three US universities (Carnegie Mellon, University of Washington, and Notre Dame). Sleep was tracked using Fitbit devices over a semester so these are actually measured sleep values and not self-reported survey answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key variables are:\n",
    "- **TotalSleepTime**: Average nightly sleep in minutes. The CDC recommends 7+ hours (420+ minutes) for adults aged 18-25. Values in this dataset range from around 250 to 550 minutes.\n",
    "- **bedtime_mssd**: Mean successive squared difference of bedtime, which basically measures how inconsistent a student's bedtime is from night to night. Higher values mean more irregular sleep schedules. This matters because sleep regularity has been shown to be just as important as total sleep duration for cognitive performance.\n",
    "- **midpoint_sleep**: The midpoint of the sleep period in minutes from midnight. Higher values mean later sleep timing (e.g., 360 = 6:00 AM midpoint, so sleeping roughly 2 AM to 10 AM).\n",
    "- **daytime_sleep**: Average minutes of daytime sleep (naps). High values might mean students aren't getting enough sleep at night.\n",
    "- **frac_nights_with_data**: Fraction of nights where Fitbit data was actually recorded. Lower values mean more missing nights which could make the data less reliable.\n",
    "- **cum_gpa** and **term_gpa**: Cumulative and term GPA on a 4.0 scale.\n",
    "- **term_units**: Number of credit units taken that term. Also provided as a z-score (Zterm_units_ZofZ).\n",
    "- **demo_race**, **demo_gender**, **demo_firstgen**: Demographic variables (coded as 0/1).\n",
    "- **study** and **cohort**: Identifiers for which university and cohort the student belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation here is that it doesn't have screen time or physical activity variables, so we can't test the full interaction from our research question with just this data. However, it actually gives us something the Mendeley dataset doesn't which is objective, device-measured sleep data paired with real GPA from US college students. So we can use it to check whether the sleep to academic performance connection holds up with real measured data instead of only relying on self-reported surveys. The Fitbit measurements also give us sleep consistency (bedtime_mssd) which is something that survey data doesn't usually capture."

    "A. Data Collection\n",
    " A.1 Informed consent: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "X - Through our survey collection we will start with informed consent through a briefing of our study as well as questions that will ensure documentation of consent such as \"Are you aware of and do you consent to the collection and analysis of the information you provide through this form?” with a yes or no checkbox on the side.\n",
    "\n",
    " A.2 Collection bias: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "X - Our biggest concern would be social desirability bias which is when participants try to present themselves in the best possible light. In order to promote truthful and unbiased data collection we will ask them to send in a screenshot of their academic history as well as any proof of class attendance to act as evidence for their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    " A.3 Limit PII exposure: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "X - Our form will be anonymous and can be taken remotely. Participants will only need to answer the questions provided, which will all be relevant to our study. Each participant will also be identified by a number or ID rather than their name.\n",
    "\n",
    " A.4 Downstream bias mitigation: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "X - Yes, we have decided to include an optional section for demographic data such as race, gender, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Data Storage\n",
    " B.1 Data security: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "X - The data and forms will only vbe available to our emails. We will not be sharing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " B.2 Right to be forgotten: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "X - Yes, there will be a contact on the form with a caption stating that they can contact us to withdrawl from the data pool.\n",
    "\n",
    " B.3 Data retention plan: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "X - Not at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Analysis\n",
    " C.1 Missing perspectives: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "X - No, we have not sought out to address any blindspots in the analysis but our survey questions will be designed to minimize assumptions and focus on stright forward data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    " C.2 Dataset bias: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "X - Not yet, however we will.\n",
    "\n",
    " C.3 Honest representation: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " C.4 Privacy in analysis: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " C.5 Auditability: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Modeling\n",
    " D.1 Proxy discrimination: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " D.2 Fairness across groups: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " D.3 Metric selection: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " D.4 Explainability: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "X\n",
    "\n",
    " D.5 Communicate limitations: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "X - We plan to include descriptions and written sections into our final project.\n",

    "* *Team Expectation 1: Communication Protocol- We will use iMessages as our primary method for all daily communication. We expect everyone to acknowledge or respond to messages within 24 hours on weekdays. We will hold weekly virtual meetings to sync on progress, and we agree to notify the group at least 4 hours in advance if we cannot attend a scheduled session.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 2: Tone and Conflict Resolution- We will commit to a \"honest and polite\" tone. We will use \"I\" statements (like \"I think this visualization is a bit cluttered, what do you think?\") to ensure feedback feels constructive rather than personal. If a conflict arises, we will first try to resolve the issue speaking with those involved and if needed come together as a group to hear each other out. But every perspective involved will be heard and respected.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 3: Task Management & Transparency- We will send out to-do lists on messages to track our tasks. Every team member is responsible for what they are assigned to take on and communicating progress with the group. We will not wait until the meeting to communicate that we might be stuck or need help on a task; we will also message the groupchat welcoming any and all questions and updates together. If we feel that we can help a teammate we will step up to do so without taking too much burden.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 4: Shared Contribution & Coding- While we will play to our strengths (as some of us are have large coding backgrounds and others have more research backgrounds), we will still divide up the work. All code must include an appropriate comment and pushed to GitHub via a branch and Pull Request so that at least one other teammate can review and edit it for clarity and accuracy. This way we can keep track and stay organized.* \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 5: Decision Making- All decisions will be made by a majority vote. However, for time-sensitive or \"urgent\" decisions (deadlines within 12 hours), the members present at that time are authorized to make the call to ensure the project moves forward. We will document these decisions in our iMessages and ensure that all members are updated and stay included.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 6: Accountability and Support- If a teammate is struggling with a deadline due to outside responsibilities or technical issues, they must contact the group at least the night before the deadline. We will then reallocate effort as a team to help offer support. However, we acknowledge that if a member consistently fails to meet agreed-upon tasks without communication, we will follow the official policy of sending a written warning before escalating to the professor by Week 7.*"
