    "What is the relationship between time spent on social media between the hours of 10 PM to 2 AM, and short-term academic performance such as lecture attendance, homework score, and exam scores? Specifically, we want to examine whether screen use within one hour before bedtime, are associated with sleep quality (measured using a standardized sleep scale), and whether these sleep variables are related to both short-term and long-term academic performance (exam scores and GPA). The goal is to determine whether more screen exposure during later hours in the night is linked to poorer sleep and, in turn, lower academic performance.\n"

    "Living in an era where technology is constantly evolving, it has impacted our lives immensely. We use smartphones and screens for almost every aspect of our student lives, from attending virtual lectures to unwinding with social media after a long day of classes. However, we believe that the downside of this constant connectivity is that it is fundamentally shifting our sleep patterns and, as a result, our ability to perform academically. Because technology is so integrated into our generation’s lifestyle, we often don't realize how much our late-night scrolling might be the culprit behind our morning brain fog.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic is relevant to our team as we’ve noticed how our own academic motivation seems to dip when our screen time spikes. We believe that excessive screen exposure disrupts the delicate balance required for restorative rest and cognitive functioning [1, 2]. We’ve seen firsthand how a night spent on devices leads to a struggle to focus the next day, and we believe there is a direct link between these digital habits and the grades we see on our transcripts [3, 6].\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the work done previously by other researchers, we found that high screen time is consistently correlated with delayed sleep onset and reduced total sleep duration [1]. Previous cross-sectional analyses have shown that for young adults and children, excessive screen use is a primary predictor of poor sleep quality, often due to blue light exposure and cognitive arousal before bed [2]. We find it particularly interesting that sleep appears to act as a \"mediator.\" This means that while screen use impacts grades, it might be doing so because it ruins sleep first [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that when screen time is limited, there are measurable improvements in sleep duration and school grades [4]. Other predictive modeling has shown that as screen time increases, the probability of achieving high academic marks decreases [6]. Because of these findings, we believe that our own research will reveal a similar relationship. Thus, we decided to conduct this research project to see if there is a statistically significant relationship between screen time, sleep quality, and academic achievement within our own target population.\n",

    "We hypothesize that greater time spent using social media applications between 10 PM and 2 AM will lead to poorer sleep quality measured by our standardized sleep scale. Specifically we believe that using social media within 1 hour of going to sleep will have a much bigger effect. We further predict that the poor sleep quality will lead to worse short-term academic performance which includes, lower test scares, less lectures being attended, lower homework scores, and a reduction in overall GPA. We based our hypothesis based on prior research that suggests that phone usage before sleep disrupts sleep patterns, which furthermore affects cognitive functions and academic outcomes. "

    "The ideal dataset for this research question would be a dataset that includes detailed information on late night social media use, sleep quality, and academic performance, catered more towards college students. Key variables in this dataset would be, time spent on social media between 10 PM and 2 AM, screentime use within 1 hour of sleep, student GPA, sleep quality scores, lecture attendence, and possibly average exam or homework scores. Other more demographic variables such as age, grade level, region, and school can be useful information. The dataset should include several hundred students in order to account for variation and to ensure there is a good and large representative population. Data for this can be collected through surveys that record students' sleep time, sleep quality, and social media usage before sleep, along with academic information about the students such as GPA or lecture attendance. This data would be stored in a structured database where each row represents a studenta nd each column represents a different variable we are measuring. \n",

This dataset contains over 1200 response from indivduals aged from 12 tom 18 and measures screen time, including device use and screen exposure before bed, and also sleep duration and tiredness during the day. The dataset also includes some academic inddicator variables such as school careds which makes it very useful and easy to analyze the relationship between late night screen use and to sleep outcomes tom academic performance.\n",

    "Second Dataset: Student Sleep Patterns (Kaggle)\n",
    "This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanjamal002/student-sleep-patterns?utm_source=chatgpt.com. This dataset contains valuable infomration on sleep habits and different lifestyle factors for university studnets. Key variables here include sleep duration and patterns, along with different lifestyle measures that could be reltated to screen use and nighttime behaviors. While this dataset doesnt directly mention academic performance of the students it can be useful to also analyze relationships between sleep qualtiy and other factors within students lives, and combine the analyzis with other academic data.\n",

    "* *Team Expectation 1: Communication Protocol- We will use iMessages as our primary method for all daily communication. We expect everyone to acknowledge or respond to messages within 24 hours on weekdays. We will hold weekly virtual meetings to sync on progress, and we agree to notify the group at least 4 hours in advance if we cannot attend a scheduled session.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 2: Tone and Conflict Resolution- We will commit to a \"blunt but polite\" tone. We will use \"I\" statements (like \"I think this visualization is a bit cluttered, what do you think?\") to ensure feedback feels constructive rather than personal. If a conflict arises, we will first try to resolve the issue speaking with those involved and if needed come together as a group to hear each other out.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 3: Task Management & Transparency- We will send out to-do lists on messages to track our tasks. Every team member is responsible for what they are assigned to take on and communicating progress with the group. We will not wait until the meeting to communicate that we might be stuck or need help on a task; we will message the groupchat welcoming any and all questions and updates together.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 4: Shared Contribution & Coding- While we will play to our strengths (as some of us are have large coding backgrounds and others have more research backgrounds), we will still divide work. All code must be well-commented and pushed to GitHub via a branch and Pull Request so that at least one other teammate can review and edit it for clarity and accuracy.* \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 5: Decision Making- All decisions will be made by a majority vote. However, for time-sensitive or \"urgent\" decisions (deadlines within 12 hours), the members present at that time are authorized to make the call to ensure the project moves forward. We will document these decisions in our iMessages and ensure that all members are updated.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Team Expectation 6: Accountability and Support- If a teammate is struggling with a deadline due to outside responsibilities or technical issues, they must contact the group at least the night before the deadline. We will then reallocate effort as a team to help offer support. However, we acknowledge that if a member consistently fails to meet agreed-upon tasks without communication, we will follow the official policy of sending a written warning before escalating to the professor by Week 7.*"
